## Given the provided information about the UTO (Unified Topic Operator), here are some ideas on what you could target using TLA+:

### Resource Deletion Safety:

- **Goal**: Ensure that when a KafkaTopic resource is deleted, the corresponding topic in Kafka is also deleted if and only if the conditions dictate so.
- **Properties**: If a KafkaTopic is deleted with the finalizer in place and no other conflicting KafkaTopic exists, the Kafka topic should be deleted.
If strimzi.io/managed: false annotation is present, deleting a KafkaTopic should not result in the Kafka topic's deletion.

### Idempotence and Reconciliation:

- **Goal**: Verify that the operator's reconciliation processes are idempotent and reach a stable state.
- **Properties**: If no changes are made to a KafkaTopic or the environment, running the reconciliation process repeatedly should not change the state.
After some finite number of reconciliations, the system should reach a stable state.

### Consistency between KafkaTopic and Kafka topic:

- **Goal**: Ensure that the state of the Kafka topic always eventually reflects the state of the KafkaTopic resource, barring exceptions like the strimzi.io/managed: false annotation.
- **Properties**: If a KafkaTopic resource is modified, the changes should eventually be reflected in the Kafka topic unless specified otherwise.
No Kafka topic should exist without a corresponding KafkaTopic, and vice-versa, unless explicitly dictated.

### Race Conditions during Deployment:

- **Goal**: Model potential race conditions between the operator reacting to new KafkaTopics and applications starting that might trigger auto-creation of topics.
- **Properties**: In cases where the application wins the race, the topics should eventually be reconciled to match the desired KafkaTopic.spec.
If auto.create.topics.enable is true, the operator should log a warning.

### Conflict Resolution:

- **Goal**: Ensure proper handling when multiple KafkaTopics try to manage the same Kafka topic.
- **Properties**: Only the KafkaTopic with the oldest metadata.creationTimestamp should manage the topic.
All other KafkaTopics should be marked as conflicting and should not make changes to the Kafka topic.

### Operational Scenarios:

- **Goal**: Model and verify scenarios like changing metadata.name, changing spec.topicName, decreasing spec.partitions, etc.
- **Properties**: Desired behaviors, like errors or other reactions, should occur when these operational actions are performed.

### Finalizer Behavior:

- **Goal**: Ensure that the strimzi.io/topic-operator finalizer's presence or absence behaves as intended in different scenarios.
- **Properties**: When STRIMZI_USE_FINALIZER=true, the finalizer should be present on all relevant KafkaTopics.
When STRIMZI_USE_FINALIZER=false, the finalizer should be removed if present.
