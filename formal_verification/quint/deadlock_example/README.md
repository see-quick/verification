## Explanation:

State Transitions and Deadlock Analysis

State 0 → { heldBy: (-1, -1) }
	•	No resources are held (initial state). ✅
	•	The system is in a valid starting condition.
	•	DeadlockCondition holds because deadlock has not yet occurred.

⸻

State 1 → { heldBy: (1, -1) }
	•	Process P1 acquires R1, but R2 remains free.
	•	Process P2 has not yet acted.
	•	No deadlock yet; system remains functional. ✅

⸻

State 2 → { heldBy: (1, -1) }
	•	Process P2 attempts an action.
	•	It could acquire R2, but instead picks a release action.
	•	The system remains in the same state. ✅

⸻

State 3 → { heldBy: (1, 2) }
	•	Process P2 acquires R2 while P1 is still holding R1.
	•	Now, a deadlock occurs:
	•	P1 needs R2 but can’t get it.
	•	P2 needs R1 but can’t get it.
	•	No further actions can be taken—both processes are stuck indefinitely. ❌

⸻

Violation Detected
	•	The invariant not(deadlock) fails.
	•	quint correctly detects the deadlock.
	•	Execution stops because the system is now irreversibly blocked.

⸻

Summary
	1.	P1 acquires R1. ✅
	2.	P2 acquires R2. ✅
	3.	Both now wait for each other’s resource. ❌
	4.	Deadlock occurs. 💀
	5.	quint correctly flags an invariant violation. 🚨
