# Ideas to support in UserOperator model

## 🔵 1. Add “status.reason” field for Errors

Right now, users are either “Pending”, “Ready”, or “Deleted”.
You could add a 4th possible situation: "Error" with a reason like "SecretMissing", "InvalidAcl", etc.
You would then extend reconciliation to detect invalid states and move users into Error.
This matches real controller behavior.

Example:
```quint
type KafkaUserStatusCondition = {
  status: str,
  reason: str
}
```
and then in reconciliation:
```quint
    status: { conditions: {
      status: "Error",
      reason: "MissingSecret"
    } 
}
```

## 🔵 2. Introduce “Generation” field (Spec changes)

In Kubernetes, resources have a .metadata.generation and .status.observedGeneration.
You could model this!
	•	When spec changes (updateUser), bump .metadata.generation.
	•	In reconcile, when successful, set .status.observedGeneration = .metadata.generation.

This lets you model stale vs fresh reconciliations.

🔵 3. More complex ACL generation

You could:
•	Randomize the operation
•	Randomize the resource.typeAcl
•	Randomize between prefix and literal pattern types

This would create richer ACLs and test the ACL invariants harder.
