# Property-based testing 

One of the realization of [property-based testing](https://blog.johanneslink.net/2018/03/24/property-based-testing-in-java-introduction/) 
is **Stateful testing**. Stateful testing is one of the patterns to finding a good properties in the property-based testing.
Moreover, in the object-oriented programming languages, we could simply describe a program via state machine. This state
machine then we could use as a model to evaluate our properties and therefore decided if such model is correct.
